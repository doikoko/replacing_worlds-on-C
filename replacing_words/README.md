---Program to replace words in text:---

dict.txt: dictionary example
replacing_words/replacing_words.c: main file (the first is already compiled), begins the program.
create_dict: Because different text editors may write the "\t" symbol differently, it is better to use this.

(For Linux, you can use ./fileName.)
(If this doesn't work on Windows, compile the .c file and run it with any Windows C compiler.)
